# Compiler Versions Used in Lido Project

For Lido project coordination, governance, and funds management, we use [Aragon](https://aragon.org/dao), a
well-developed and proven DAO Framework. The current stable release of its
Kernel, [4.4.0](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/tree/v4.4.0), is fixed on a specific compiler
version - [solc 0.4.24](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/), which is currently outdated. Keeping security and
consistency in mind, we decided to stay on an older yet proven combination. Therefore, for all the contracts under
Aragon management (`Lido`, `stETH`), we use the `solc 0.4.24` release.

For the `wstETH` contract, we use `solc 0.6.12`, as it is non-upgradeable and bound to this version.

For the other contracts, newer compiler versions are used.

The 0.8.25 version of the compiler was introduced for Lido Vaults to be able to support [OpenZeppelin v5.2.0](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/v5.2.0) dependencies (under the "@openzeppelin/contracts-v5.2" alias).

The OpenZeppelin 5.2.0 upgradeable contracts are copied locally in this repository (`contracts/openzeppelin/5.2`) instead of being imported from npm. This is because the original upgradeable contracts import from "@openzeppelin/contracts", but we use a custom alias "@openzeppelin/contracts-v5.2" to manage multiple OpenZeppelin versions. To resolve these import conflicts, we maintain local copies of the upgradeable contracts with corrected import paths that reference our aliased version.
