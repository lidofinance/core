/**
 * @title StakingVault
 * @author Lido
 * @notice
 *
 * StakingVault is a private staking pool that enables staking with a designated node operator.
 * Each StakingVault includes an accounting system that tracks its valuation via reports.
 *
 * The StakingVault can be used as a backing for minting new stETH if the StakingVault is connected to the VaultHub.
 * When minting stETH backed by the StakingVault, the VaultHub locks a portion of the StakingVault's valuation,
 * which cannot be withdrawn by the owner. If the locked amount exceeds the StakingVault's valuation,
 * the StakingVault enters the unbalanced state.
 * In this state, the VaultHub can force-rebalance the StakingVault by withdrawing a portion of the locked amount
 * and writing off the locked amount to restore the balanced state.
 * The owner can voluntarily rebalance the StakingVault in any state or by simply
 * supplying more ether to increase the valuation.
 *
 * Access
 * - Owner:
 *   - `fund()`
 *   - `withdraw()`
 *   - `requestValidatorExit()`
 *   - `rebalance()`
 * - Operator:
 *   - `depositToBeaconChain()`
 * - VaultHub:
 *   - `lock()`
 *   - `report()`
 *   - `rebalance()`
 * - Anyone:
 *   - Can send ETH directly to the vault (treated as rewards)
 *
 * BeaconProxy
 * The contract is designed as a beacon proxy implementation, allowing all StakingVault instances
 * to be upgraded simultaneously through the beacon contract. The implementation is petrified
 * (non-initializable) and contains immutable references to the VaultHub and the beacon chain
 * deposit contract.
 *
