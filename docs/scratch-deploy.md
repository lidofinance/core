# Deploy Lido protocol middleware from scratch

## TL;DR

```shell
# Start a local Ethereum node
anvil -p 8555 --base-fee 0 --gas-price 0

# In a separate terminal, run the deployment script
bash scripts/dao-local-deploy.sh
```

## Requirements

Same as for the rest of the repo, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## General Information

The repository contains bash scripts for deploying the DAO across various environments:

- Local Node Deployment - `scripts/dao-local-deploy.sh` (Supports Ganache, Anvil, Hardhat Network, and other local
  Ethereum nodes)
- Holesky Testnet Deployment â€“ `scripts/dao-holesky-deploy.sh`

The protocol requires configuration of numerous parameters for a scratch deployment. The default configurations are
stored in JSON files named `deployed-<deploy env>-defaults.json`, where `<deploy env>` represents the target
environment. Currently, a single default configuration file exists: `deployed-testnet-defaults.json`, which is tailored
for testnet deployments. This configuration differs from the mainnet setup, featuring shorter vote durations and more
frequent oracle report cycles, among other adjustments.

> [!NOTE]
> Some parameters in the default configuration file are intentionally set to `null`, indicating that they require
> further specification during the deployment process.

The deployment script performs the following steps regarding configuration:

1. Copies the appropriate default configuration file (e.g., `deployed-testnet-defaults.json`) to a new file named
   `deployed-<network name>.json`, where `<network name>` corresponds to a network configuration defined in
   `hardhat.config.js`.

2. Populates the `deployed-<network name>.json` file with specific contract addresses and transaction hashes as the
   deployment progresses.

Detailed information for each setup is provided in the sections below.

> [!NOTE]
> Aragon UI for Lido DAO is to be deprecated and replaced by a custom solution, thus not included in the deployment
> script, see https://research.lido.fi/t/discontinuation-of-aragon-ui-use/7992.

### Deployment Steps

A detailed overview of the deployment script's process:

- Prepare `deployed-<network name>.json` file
  - Copied from `deployed-testnet-defaults.json`
  - Enhanced with environment variable values, e.g., `DEPLOYER`
  - Progressively updated with deployed contract information
- (optional) Deploy DepositContract
  - Skipped if DepositContract address is pre-specified
- (optional) Deploy ENS
  - Skipped if ENS Registry address is pre-specified
- Deploy Aragon framework environment
- Deploy standard Aragon apps contracts (e.g., `Agent`, `Voting`)
- Deploy `LidoTemplate` contract
  - Auxiliary contract for DAO configuration
- Deploy Lido custom Aragon apps implementations (bases) for `Lido`, `LegacyOracle`, `NodeOperatorsRegistry`
- Register Lido APM name in ENS
- Deploy Aragon package manager contract `APMRegistry` (via `LidoTemplate`)
- Deploy Lido custom Aragon apps repo contracts (via `LidoTemplate`)
- Deploy Lido DAO (via `LidoTemplate`)
- Issue DAO tokens (via `LidoTemplate`)
- Deploy non-Aragon Lido contracts: `OracleDaemonConfig`, `LidoLocator`, `OracleReportSanityChecker`, `EIP712StETH`,
  `WstETH`, `WithdrawalQueueERC721`, `WithdrawalVault`, `LidoExecutionLayerRewardsVault`, `StakingRouter`,
  `DepositSecurityModule`, `AccountingOracle`, `HashConsensus` for AccountingOracle, `ValidatorsExitBusOracle`,
  `HashConsensus` for ValidatorsExitBusOracle, `Burner`
- Finalize Lido DAO deployment: issue unvested LDO tokens, set Aragon permissions, register Lido DAO name in Aragon ID
  (via `LidoTemplate`)
- Initialize non-Aragon Lido contracts
- Set parameters of `OracleDaemonConfig`
- Setup non-Aragon permissions
- Plug NodeOperatorsRegistry as Curated staking module
- Transfer all admin roles from deployer to `Agent`
  - OpenZeppelin admin roles: `Burner`, `HashConsensus` for `AccountingOracle`, `HashConsensus` for
    `ValidatorsExitBusOracle`,
    `StakingRouter`, `AccountingOracle`, `ValidatorsExitBusOracle`, `WithdrawalQueueERC721`, `OracleDaemonConfig`
  - OssifiableProxy admin roles: `LidoLocator`, `StakingRouter`, `AccountingOracle`, `ValidatorsExitBusOracle`,
    `WithdrawalQueueERC721`
  - `DepositSecurityModule` owner

## Deployment Environments

### Local Deployment

This section describes how to deploy the DAO to a local development node (such as Anvil, Hardhat, or Ganache) running
at http://127.0.0.1:8555.

The deployment process utilizes the default test account `0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266`, which is derived
from the standard mnemonic phrase: `test test test test test test test test test test test junk`

To ensure a successful deployment, configure your local node with the default test accounts associated with this
mnemonic.

Follow these steps for local deployment:

1. Run `yarn install` (ensure repo dependencies are installed)
2. Run the node on port 8555 (for the commands, see subsections below)
3. Run the deploy script `bash scripts/dao-local-deploy.sh` from root repo directory
4. Check out the deploy artifacts in `deployed-local.json`

#### Supported Local Nodes

##### Anvil

```shell
anvil -p 8555 --mnemonic "test test test test test test test test test test test junk" --base-fee 0 --gas-price 0
```

##### Hardhat Node

```shell
yarn hardhat node
```

### Holesky Testnet Deployment

To do Holesky deployment, the following parameters must be set up via env variables:

- `DEPLOYER`. The deployer address. The deployer must own its private key. To ensure proper operation, it should have an
  adequate amount of ether. The total deployment gas cost is approximately 120,000,000 gas, and this cost can vary based
  on whether specific components of the environment, such as the DepositContract, are deployed or not.
- `RPC_URL`. Address of the Ethereum RPC node to use. E.g. for Infura it is
  `https://holesky.infura.io/v3/<yourProjectId>`
- `GAS_PRIORITY_FEE`. Gas priority fee. By default set to `2`
- `GAS_MAX_FEE`. Gas max fee. By default set to `100`
- `GATE_SEAL_FACTORY`. Address of the [GateSeal Factory](https://github.com/lidofinance/gate-seals) contract. Must be
  deployed in advance. Can be set to any `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` to debug deployment
- `WITHDRAWAL_QUEUE_BASE_URI`. BaseURI for WithdrawalQueueERC721. By default not set (left an empty string)
- `DSM_PREDEFINED_ADDRESS`. Address to use instead of deploying `DepositSecurityModule` or `null` otherwise. If used,
  the deposits can be made by calling `Lido.deposit` from the address.

Also you need to specify `DEPLOYER` private key in `accounts.json` under `/eth/holesky` like `"holesky": ["<key>"]`. See
`accounts.sample.json` for an example.

To start the deployment, run (the env variables must already be defined) from the root repo directory, e.g.:

```shell
bash scripts/scratch/dao-holesky-deploy.sh
```

Deployment artifacts information will be stored in `deployed-holesky.json`.

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### Publishing Sources to Etherscan

```shell
yarn verify:deployed --network <network> (--file <path-to-deployed-json>)
```

#### Issues with verification of part of the contracts deployed from factories

There are some contracts deployed from other contracts for which automatic hardhat etherscan verification fails:

- `AppProxyUpgradeable` of multiple contracts (`app:lido`, `app:node-operators-registry`, `app:oracle`,
  `app:voting`, ...)
- `KernelProxy` -- proxy for `Kernel`
- `AppProxyPinned` -- proxy for `EVMScriptRegistry`
- `MiniMeToken` -- LDO token
- `CallsScript` -- Aragon internal contract
- `EVMScriptRegistry` -- Aragon internal contract

The workaround used during Holesky deployment is to deploy auxiliary instances of these contracts standalone and verify
them via hardhat Etherscan plugin. After this Etherscan will mark the target contracts as verified by "Similar Match
Source Code".

Note that some contracts require additional auxiliary contracts to be deployed. Namely, the constructor of
`AppProxyPinned` depends on proxy implementation ("base" in Aragon terms) contract with `initialize()` function and
`Kernel` contract, which must return the implementation by call `kernel().getApp(KERNEL_APP_BASES_NAMESPACE, _appId)`.
See `@aragon/os/contracts/apps/AppProxyBase.sol` for the details.

### Initialization to Fully Operational State

In order to make the protocol fully operational, the following additional steps are required:

- add oracle committee members to `HashConsensus` contracts for `AccountingOracle` and `ValidatorsExitBusOracle`:
  `HashConsensus.addMember`;
- initialize initial epoch for `HashConsensus` contracts for `AccountingOracle` and `ValidatorsExitBusOracle`:
  `HashConsensus.updateInitialEpoch`;
- add guardians to `DepositSecurityModule`: `DepositSecurityModule.addGuardians`;
- resume protocol: `Lido.resume`;
- resume WithdrawalQueue: `WithdrawalQueueERC721.resume`;
- add at least one Node Operator: `NodeOperatorsRegistry.addNodeOperator`;
- add validator keys to the Node Operators: `NodeOperatorsRegistry.addSigningKeys`;
- set staking limits for the Node Operators: `NodeOperatorsRegistry.setNodeOperatorStakingLimit`.

> [!NOTE]
> Some of these actions require prior granting of the required roles, e.g. `STAKING_MODULE_MANAGE_ROLE` for
> `StakingRouter.addStakingModule`:

```js
await stakingRouter.grantRole(STAKING_MODULE_MANAGE_ROLE, agent.address, { from: agent.address });
await stakingRouter.addStakingModule(
  state.nodeOperatorsRegistry.deployParameters.stakingModuleTypeId,
  nodeOperatorsRegistry.address,
  NOR_STAKING_MODULE_STAKE_SHARE_LIMIT_BP,
  NOR_STAKING_MODULE_PRIORITY_EXIT_SHARE_THRESHOLD_BP,
  NOR_STAKING_MODULE_MODULE_FEE_BP,
  NOR_STAKING_MODULE_TREASURY_FEE_BP,
  NOR_STAKING_MODULE_MAX_DEPOSITS_PER_BLOCK,
  NOR_STAKING_MODULE_MIN_DEPOSIT_BLOCK_DISTANCE,
  { from: agent.address },
);
await stakingRouter.renounceRole(STAKING_MODULE_MANAGE_ROLE, agent.address, { from: agent.address });
```
